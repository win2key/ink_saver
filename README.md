# ink_saver

Hello parents!
Hope you're in a good shape!

These days children have to learn from home, and teachers send tonns of material to print, mostly in PDF.
This script intended to brighten PDF files and save your printer inks.

Considering you have installed: 
1) gs (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ghostscript)
2) convert (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imagemagick)
3) ffmpeg (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg)

If no, be prepared:  
$ brew install gs imagemagic ffmpeg

script usage:
$ ./I\'m\ dolphin\,\ trust\ me.sh 

it searches for PFDs in current folder and convert them into a brighten copy.

Profit! 
Printing light copies significantly saves ink.




Take care!
Stay well!
Clean your hands with a soap!



Cheers!
